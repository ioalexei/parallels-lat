The Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX) [has launched](https://centre.humdata.org/announcing-the-hdx-humanitarian-api/) a data access API. 

>  Although HDX has an existing API for the data catalogue (through 
> CKAN), it only supports interaction with metadata. HDX HAPI enables 
> direct access to the data itself.

I can see this being really useful for automating the way our team provides data to colleagues - we can now make sure we always have the most recent data in our ArcGIS online. 

More info on the landing page: https://data.humdata.org/hapi

Launched at the same time, [HDX Signals](https://data.humdata.org/signals) also looks cool - automated messages when a significant change is detected in a dataset update.
