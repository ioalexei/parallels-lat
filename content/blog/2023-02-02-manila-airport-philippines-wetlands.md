Some maps I made for a Global Witness report on the environmental and community impact of a new aiport near Manile are now online: [Global Witness: Runway risk](https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/holding-corporates-account/runaway-risk/). 

I made two maps that show an overview of the proposed airport site and how it overlaps sensitive wetland areas, and a wider view of other environmentally-sensitive areas nearby. 

It was tricky to combine various landcover datasets and get them to look "natural" sitting next to each other, and especially to find a symbol for wetlands that didn't look too overbearing over a large area.
