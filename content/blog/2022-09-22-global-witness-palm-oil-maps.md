Some maps I made for a Global Witness report on the effects of palm oil production in the Amazon are now online: [Global Witness: Amazon Palm](
https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/environmental-activists/amazon-palm/). 

The maps were intended to illustrate the encroachent of palm plantations on indigenous lands and violence against indigenous communities. 

The maps seem to have been downsampled in the process of getting the report online, but appear at full quality in the PDF version. 

There are three maps in the PDF report, two in the online version.
