Published a summary of things our team worked on in 2023 [on the team blog](https://medium.com/digital-and-innovation-at-british-red-cross/what-the-gis-im-team-enjoyed-working-on-in-2023-9cc0cc9f5413?source=collection_home---4------1-----------------------). It's not necessarily the biggest or most important things that we worked on (although some of it falls into those categories) - I asked people on the team to give me the things they found most enjoyable or rewarding to work on.
