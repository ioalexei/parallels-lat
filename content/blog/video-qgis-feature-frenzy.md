Watched John Bryant & Nyall Dawson's [QGIS Feature Frenzy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K10DZaNPEEk) from the [2023 FOSS4G State of the Map Oceania](https://2023.foss4g-oceania.org/) conference. 

They run through a bunch of interesting updates in the latest QGIS release - including:

  * Ability to connect to remote cloud-optimised geotiffs - e.g. on AWS
  * Ability to download remote vector tile basemaps in .mbtiles format
  * Annotation layers for arbitrarily positioning text and icons in the main map canvas
  * HTML support in labels for mixed/expression-driven font styling 
  * Running of QGIS tools from outside QGIS using [`qgis_process`](https://spatialthoughts.com/2022/07/30/qgis_process_command_line/)
