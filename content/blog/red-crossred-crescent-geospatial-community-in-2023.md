At work we have a geospatial community of practice for people working on geo stuff in different Red Cross/Red Crescent societies - a fancy name for a regular Zoom call. It's a chance for us to hear what other people are working on, what they're using geospatial tools and data for, and ask questions. 

Since it's on a Zoom call and we don't publish summaries I didn't want to completely lose all record of the content, so I wrote up a short summary of the presentations we had in 2023, published on the [BRC Medium blog](https://medium.com/digital-and-innovation-at-british-red-cross/red-cross-geo-calls-2023-summary-b5af16caae15?source=collection_home---4------0-----------------------).
