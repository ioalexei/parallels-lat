Enjoyed this article by Felipe Pepe: [The Gentrification of Video Game History](https://felipepepe.medium.com/the-gentrification-of-video-game-history-dfe11f1e08ae).

He provincialises US gaming history, highlighting games that were popular outside of the US and 
ignored in typical histories of gaming. 

> This helps us understand how games like Free Fire can reach 150 million daily users but have basically zero presence 
> in gamer circles & media — it’s a free-to-play battle royale mobile game created in Vietnam.

He mentions a few interesting-sounding books: 
* [Real Games: What's legitimate and what's not in contemporary videogames](https://direct.mit.edu/books/monograph/4527/Real-GamesWhat-s-Legitimate-and-What-s-Not-in) by Mia Consalvo & Christopher A. Paul 
* [The Videogame Industry Does Not Exist](https://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-monograph/5572/The-Videogame-Industry-Does-Not-ExistWhy-We-Should) by Brendan Keogh
