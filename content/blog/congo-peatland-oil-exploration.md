A map I made for a Global Witness report on the environmental effects of il exploration in the Republic of Congo is now online: [Global Witness: 
What lies beneath](https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/forests/what-lies-beneath/). 

The map shows the overlap between oil exploration and environmentally-sensitive peatland areas.
