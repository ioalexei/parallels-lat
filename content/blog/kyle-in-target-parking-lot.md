I came across this photo by Caroline Drake in an issue of Aperture in 2021 and it will pop into my head every couple of months. Probably with about the same frequency that I see a map of Idaho online.

As a side note, if you're in the UK you can read Aperture for free using the [Libby library app](https://libbyapp.com).
