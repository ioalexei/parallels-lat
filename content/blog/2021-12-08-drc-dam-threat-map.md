A map I made for a Global Witness report on the environmental effects of the Sombwe dam in DR Congo is now online: [Global Witness: 
Before the Flood](
https://www.globalwitness.org/documents/20224/Before_the_Flood_EN_-_December_2021.pdf) (PDF). 

The map shows how the flooding from the proposed dam will impact the adjacent Upemba National Park.
