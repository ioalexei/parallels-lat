A recent podcast from the Government Design Service about [Maps in services](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2021/11/30/podcast-maps-in-services/) spent some time talking about the map design standards put together by the UK Department for the Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra). The standards are hosted on GitHub [here](https://github.com/DEFRA/design-standards/blob/master/Maps.md). Perhaps calling them 'standards' is a stretch -- it's more broad guidelines -- but there are useful notes about accessibility and inclusive design for webmaps.
