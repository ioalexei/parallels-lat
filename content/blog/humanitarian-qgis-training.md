Published a post on the team blog on [Running a humanitarian GIS training at BRC](
https://medium.com/digital-and-innovation-at-british-red-cross/running-a-humanitarian-gis-training-at-brc-4cac44dc1dc3) - summarising the QGIS course I designed and ran with a colleague. 

We're working on making the materials available on an open site so that anyone can run the same training.
