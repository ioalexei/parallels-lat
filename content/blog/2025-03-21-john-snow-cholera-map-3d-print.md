Another post on a link I saved browsing 30daymapchallenge submissions on the Datawrapper blog: [Alex Selby-Boothroyd](https://bsky.app/profile/alexselbyb.bsky.social)'s 3d-printed recreation of the famous John Snow cholera map. It looks way better than I'd have thought if you'd just described it to me.
