Published a post on the Learn SIMS site on how I add [terrain visualisation to maps in QGIS](https://learn-sims.org/geospatial/creating-a-shaded-relief-map-in-qgis/).

It covers getting SRTM data, processing it in QGIS and styling tips to get a more "natural" look when combined with other data/layers.
